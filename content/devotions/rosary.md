### About the Rosary

The Rosary is a meditative prayer that combines vocal prayer with contemplation of the mysteries of Christ’s life. It developed in the Middle Ages and was popularized by St. Dominic. Each decade invites the faithful to “announce” a mystery and then immerse themselves in that scene while praying ten Hail Marys.
