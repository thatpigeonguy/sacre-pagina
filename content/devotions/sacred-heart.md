### About the Sacred Heart Devotion

Revealed to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque (1673–1675), this devotion centers on Christ’s infinite love symbolized by His wounded heart. The Morning Offering unites every moment of the day with His redemptive work, while the Act of Consecration places the soul entirely under the loving reign of the Sacred Heart.
