### The Prayer

#### English

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,  
that never was it known  
that anyone who fled to thy protection,  
implored thy help,  
or sought thy intercession  
was left unaided.  
Inspired by this confidence,  
I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother;  
to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.  
O Mother of the Word Incarnate,  
despise not my petitions,  
but in thy mercy hear and answer me.  
Amen.

#### Latin

Memorare, O piissima Virgo Maria,  
non esse auditum a saeculo,  
quemquam ad tua currentem praesidia,  
tua implorantem auxilia,  
tua petentem suffragia,  
esse derelictum.  
Ego tali confidentia ad te, Virgo Virginum, Mater, curro;  
ad te venio, coram te gemens peccator assisto.  
Noli, Mater Verbi, verba mea despicere,  
sed audi propitia et exaudi.  
Amen.
