### The Prayer

#### English

Hail Mary, full of grace,  
the Lord is with thee.  
Blessed art thou among women,  
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
Holy Mary, Mother of God,  
pray for us sinners,  
now and at the hour of our death.  
Amen.

Dominus tecum.  
Benedicta tu in mulieribus,  
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.  
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,  
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,  
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.  
Amen.

### About this Prayer

The Hail Mary combines the angel Gabriel’s greeting (Luke 1:28) and Elizabeth’s words (Luke 1:42) with a later medieval petition. It is the pre-eminent Marian devotion, forming the heart of the Rosary and countless other devotions.
