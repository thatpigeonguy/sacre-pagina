## The Prayer

### English

O my God,  
I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,  
and I detest all my sins,  
because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell,  
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God,  
Who art all-good and deserving of all my love.  

I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,  
to confess my sins,  
to do penance,  
and to amend my life.  

Amen.

*or*

O my God,  
I am heartily sorry for having offended You,  
and I detest all my sins because of your just punishments,  
but most of all because they offend you, my God,  
who are all good and deserving of all my love.  

I firmly resolve, with the help of your grace,  
to sin no more,  
and to avoid the near occasions of sin.  

Amen.

*or*

O my God,
I am sorry for my sins because I have offended you. 

With your help, I will sin no more.

### Latin

Deus meus, ex toto corde poenitet me,  
quia peccavi tibi,  
et maxime quia offensum te,  
summe bonum, dignum qui super omnia diligaris.  
Firm propono, adjutorio gratiae tuae,  
peccata mea fugere,  
poenitentiam agere,  
et vitam emendare.  

Amen.

*or*

Deus meus, paenitet me peccatorum meorum.
