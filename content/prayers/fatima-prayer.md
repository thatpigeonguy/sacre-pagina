### The Prayer

#### English

O my Jesus, forgive us our sins,  
save us from the fires of hell,  
lead all souls to heaven,  
especially those most in need of Thy mercy.

#### Latin

Domine Iesu, dimitte nobis debita nostra,  
libera nos ab igne inferni,  
conduc in caelum omnes animas,  
praesertim eas, quae maxime indigent misericordia tua.

### About this Prayer

The Fatima Prayer was revealed by the Angel of Peace to the three shepherd children at FÃ¡tima, Portugal, in 1916 and later reinforced by Our Lady during the 1917 apparitions. While not required, it is customarily added at the end of each decade of the Rosary, pleading for mercy, conversion, and the salvation of souls.
