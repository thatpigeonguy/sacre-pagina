### The Prayer

#### English

Our Father, Who art in heaven,  
Hallowed be Thy Name.  
Thy Kingdom come.  
Thy Will be done,  
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us.  
And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

#### Latin

Pater Noster, qui es in caelis,  
sanctificetur nomen tuum.  
Adveniat regnum tuum.  
Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra.

Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,  
et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.  
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,  
sed libera nos a malo.
Amen.
