### English
I confess to almighty God 
and to you, my brothers and sisters,  
that I have greatly sinned  
in my thoughts and in my words,  
in what I have done  
and in what I have failed to do,  
*(Strike your chest with your right hand on each "fault":)*  
through my fault, *(strike)*  
through my fault, *(strike)*  
through my most grievous fault; *(strike)*  

therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,  
all the Angels and Saints,  
and you, my brothers and sisters,  
to pray for me to the Lord our God.  

### Latin
Confiteor Deo omnipotenti  
et vobis, fratres,  
quia peccavi nimis  
cogitatione, verbo, opere et omissione:  
*(Strike your chest with your right hand on each "culpa":)*  
mea culpa, *(strike)*  
mea culpa, *(strike)*  
mea maxima culpa. *(strike)*   

Ideo precor beatam Mariam semper Virginem,  
omnes Angelos et Sanctos,  
et vos, fratres,  
orare pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum.
