### The Prayer

#### English

St. Michael the Archangel,  
defend us in battle;  
be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.  
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,  
and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host,  
by the power of God  
cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits  
who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.  
Amen.

#### Latin

Sancte Michael Archangele,  
defende nos in proelio;  
contra nequitiam et insidias diaboli esto praesidium.  
Imperet illi Deus, supplices deprecamur:  
tuque, Princeps militiae caelestis,  
satanam aliosque spiritus malignos  
qui ad perditionem animarum pervagantur in mundo,  
divina virtute in infernum detrude.  
Amen.

### About this Prayer

Composed by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 after a mystical experience, this prayer was originally ordered to be recited after every Low Mass throughout the Church. It calls upon St. Michael, guardian of the Church and leader of the heavenly armies, to protect the faithful from demonic assault and to secure the triumph of Christ’s kingdom.
