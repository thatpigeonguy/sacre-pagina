## Life

Saint Joseph, the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the foster-father of Jesus Christ, is honored as the Patron of the Universal Church. Though the Gospels record no words from him, Joseph is presented as a man of deep faith, humility, and obedience to God’s will.  

He protected the Holy Family, guiding them into Egypt to escape Herod’s persecution, and returned them safely to Nazareth.  
Tradition holds that he died in the presence of Jesus and Mary, which is why he is invoked as the patron of a happy death.
