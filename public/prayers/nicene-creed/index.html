<h2 id="the-prayer">The Prayer</h2>
<h3 id="english">English</h3>
<p>I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.</p>
<p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<h3 id="latin">Latin</h3>
<p>Credo in unum Deum,
Patrem omnipotentem,
factorem caeli et terrae,
visibilium omnium et invisibilium.</p>
<p>Et in unum Dominum Iesum Christum,
Filium Dei unigenitum,
et ex Patre natum ante omnia saecula.
Deum de Deo, lumen de lumine,
Deum verum de Deo vero,
genitum, non factum, consubstantialem Patri;
per quem omnia facta sunt.
Qui propter nos homines et propter nostram salutem
descendit de caelis,
et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria Virgine,
et homo factus est.
Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato,
passus et sepultus est,
et resurrexit tertia die
secundum Scripturas.
Et ascendit in caelum,
sedet ad dexteram Patris.
Et iterum venturus est cum gloria
iudicare vivos et mortuos,
cuius regni non erit finis.</p>
<p>Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem,
qui ex Patre Filioque procedit,
qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et conglorificatur,
qui locutus est per Prophetas.</p>
<p>Et unam, sanctam, catholicam et apostolicam Ecclesiam.
Confiteor unum baptisma in remissionem peccatorum
et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum
et vitam venturi saeculi.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-prayer">About this Prayer</h2>
<p>The Nicene Creed, or Symbolum Nicaenum, was established at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD and later expanded at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD to resolve theological disputes regarding the nature of the Trinity. It serves as the definitive statement of core Christian beliefs and remains a fundamental unifying document across the Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions. By articulating the divinity of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, it provides the essential framework for Christian doctrine and liturgical practice.</p>
