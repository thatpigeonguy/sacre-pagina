<p>Memorare, O piissima Virgo Maria,<br>
non esse auditum a saeculo,<br>
quemquam ad tua currentem praesidia,<br>
tua implorantem auxilia,<br>
tua petentem suffragia,<br>
esse derelictum.<br>
Ego tali confidentia ad te, Virgo Virginum, Mater, curro;<br>
ad te venio, coram te gemens peccator assisto.<br>
Noli, Mater Verbi, verba mea despicere,<br>
sed audi propitia et exaudi.<br>
Amen.</p>
