# Sacra Pagina

**Sacra Pagina** (Latin: "Sacred Page") is a simple, faithful, and fast directory of Catholic prayers, saints, devotions, and more.  
It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site, designed to be lightweight, distraction-free, and enduring.

## Purpose

The goal of Sacra Pagina is to serve as a Catholic prayerbook in digital form, organized like a directory:  
- **Prayers** - traditional Catholic prayers, litanies, novenas, and seasonal devotions.  
- **Saints** - brief biographies, feast days, patronages, and associated prayers.  
- **Devotions** - Rosary, Divine Mercy, Sacred Heart, First Saturdays, and more.  
etc.

This project aims to remain faithful to the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, relying on approved sources such as the *Douay-Rheims Bible*, *Catechism of the Catholic Church*, etc.

## Status

This project is in its early stages. The initial focus is on:  
- Core Catholic prayers  
- A small set of key saints and apparitions  
- Major devotions  
- Overview of the liturgical seasons  

Expansion will be gradual, following the liturgical year.
